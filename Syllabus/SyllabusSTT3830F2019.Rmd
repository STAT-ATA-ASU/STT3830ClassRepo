**Course Description:**  

A continuation of STT 3820. Topics commonly covered include experimental design; intermediate topics in least-squares regression modeling, such as multiple regression, residual analysis, transformations, higher order model terms and interactions, categorical predictors, diagnostic statistics for assessment of model fit, and model selection; one-way and two-way analysis of variance, including blocking and factorial designs. Emphasis is on a non-theoretical development of statistical techniques and on the interpretation of statistical results. Statistical software will be utilized in the analysis of data. 

**Course Objectives:**

1. Students will learn how to use a reproducible research work flow.
2. Students will improve their technology expertise.
3. Students will learn to create, to evaluate, and to interpret linear models.

**Supplemental Material:**

* Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (2013).  [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)

**Course Grading & Assessment:**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes using statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind.

You should read assigned textbook content and read/watch supplemental materials prior to coming to class. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must “speak the language” (both statistics and R) to demonstrate your knowledge effectively.

Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, students should spend approximately 2-3 hours on coursework outside of class for every hour they spend in class. For this three-hour course, you you should anticipate 6-9 hours per week of outside work.


* 24% of the course grade will come from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) assignments (4 assignments)

* 24% of the course grade will come from reproducing three [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) assignments with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

* 30% of the course grade will come from two projects.  The final project includes an oral presentation where you discuss your final model used in the predictive modeling competition --- oral presentations will take place during the final exam period --- December 9, 2019, WA 303, 11-1:30pm

* 22% of the course grade will come from two labs 



**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.


**University Policies**
